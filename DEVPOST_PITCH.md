## Tagline
**"From natural language to code execution—AI automates your entire development workflow."**

## Elevator Pitch

**Kiro Winner** is an AI-powered development automation system that transforms natural language prompts into fully executed code projects. Simply describe what you want to build—like "Create a Next.js ecommerce app with Stripe integration"—and our system uses Gemini AI to break it down into actionable steps, then automatically executes them in Kiro IDE using macOS automation. The system opens your IDE, prompts AI assistants, edits files, runs tests, monitors progress, and reports back—all hands-free. Whether you're prototyping quickly, learning new frameworks, or automating repetitive setup tasks, Kiro Winner turns your ideas into working code while you focus on what matters most.

## Alternative Taglines

1. **"Your AI coding assistant that actually writes and runs the code."**
2. **"Natural language to working code—automated."**
3. **"Describe it. We build it. Automatically."**
4. **"AI-powered development automation—from prompt to production-ready code."**

## Key Features (for Devpost description)

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Planning**: Gemini AI breaks down your natural language prompt into structured development steps
- ⚡ **Automated Execution**: macOS automation handles IDE interactions, file edits, git commits, and test runs
- 🔄 **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks progress with screenshots, file markers, and step-by-step status updates
- 🎯 **Smart Integration**: Seamlessly works with Kiro IDE's AI chat and your existing development workflow
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: iOS app for mission submission, macOS client for execution, FastAPI backend for coordination

## Problem It Solves

Developers waste countless hours on repetitive setup tasks, boilerplate code, and manual testing workflows. Kiro Winner eliminates this friction by automating the entire development lifecycle—from project initialization to test execution—all controlled through simple natural language commands.

## How It Works

1. **Submit Mission**: User describes their goal via iOS app (e.g., "Build a React calculator")
2. **AI Planning**: Backend uses Gemini AI to generate a structured plan with actionable steps
3. **Automated Execution**: macOS client polls for steps and executes them using automation APIs
4. **Progress Tracking**: System monitors file changes, captures screenshots, and reports status
5. **Completion**: User receives notification when mission is complete with full execution logs

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLite, Gemini AI
- **macOS Client**: Python automation (pyautogui, Accessibility API)
- **iOS Client**: SwiftUI
- **AI**: Google Gemini API for planning and vision analysis
